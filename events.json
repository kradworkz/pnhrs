        "description" : "The tropical haven is an eco-cultural tourism destination rich with majestic rock formations, fine white sand, and pristine blue waters. It is composed of 11 islands along the Moro Gulf supervised and protected by the Zamboanga Tourism Office and taken under the care of the local community. Once Islas, which got its name from the combination of the Spanish words “once (eleven),” and “islas (islands),” opened to the public in July last year, and it has since been frequented by foreign tourists and local backpackers for its natural infinity pool and beautiful spots scattered around its adjoining islets."
